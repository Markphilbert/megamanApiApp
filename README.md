<h3>Description</h3>

This was created using Vue3 for the sole purpose of picking up and learning Vue. The further this app is created, the more complex I attempt to make it to further my learning.

Currently only the "Home", "About" and "Contact" page have been worked on. The contact page needs a form to be complete.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>Use of Fetch and API's</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>SASS/CSS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

I would love to fix how it looks on mobile. I also would like to possibly make my own api or find a better one for this project. I chose Megaman because it was one of my favourite games as a child but I personally was unhapppy with the pixeled photos that the api provided. I would also like to fix a lot of the styling and make adjustments to the responsiveness of the site.  

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through creating this project I learned about fetch, promises, async await and even a bit of information on how api's are made. I had a lot of fun building this project and gaining so much information about these subjects. I also was challenged in my JavaScript knowledge through figuring out how to get certain functions functioning correctly. This was the first actual project I made and it was a chalenge taking concepts I knew and using them in an actual working enviroment. I also learned how SASS worked while doing this. At the time of making this app I wanted to challenge myself by adding SASS to the project to familiarize myself with how it works.
